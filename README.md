# üß® What is Firecracker?
Firecracker is a CLI tool that helps you avoid undefined user behavior by validating your API specifications.

Our CLI too is open source, enabling support from both the OpenAPI and Rust communities.

# üî® How does it work?
It takes in a swagger file, runs a series of checks on it to make sure everything is on par with the OAS, and outputs a detailed table with any alerts found, guiding you to the exact problem and location to help you solve it quickly.

It can also take in your logs and check them for business logic flaws.

# üêæ Get Started
## Installation
#### Using cURL (Linux and macOS only)
```
curl download.blstsecurity.com | /bin/bash
```

#### Direct download
You can also download the binary file directly from [our website](https://www.blstsecurity.com/firecracker).
This is a binary file and you DO NOT have to install Rust.

## Usage
After installing the CLI, verify it's working by running
```
firecracker --version
```

#### Swagger scan
```
firecracker swagger --file <PATH> --output <PATH> --verbosity <0/1/2>
```

#### Logs scan
First, start by mapping your logs by running
```
firecracker map --file <LOGS_FILE_PATH> --output <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME>
```
##### Passive checking for anomalies (1 step)
To run the decider only to **passively** check for anomalies in your logs, run
```
firecracker decide --file <LOGS_FILE_PATH> --map <MAPPED_FILE_PATH>
```
##### Active attacking and checking for anomalies (2 steps)
After mapping, prepare the attacker by running the command below.
This will print the populations (API groups) so you can choose which one you want to run the attacker on.
```
firecracker prepare --url <URL_TO_ATTACK> --map <MAPPED_FILE_PATH>
```
Now you can use the attacker to **actively** attack the API by running
```
firecracker attack --map <MAPPED_FILE_PATH> (the same one you used in the prepare step) --output <OUTPUT_FILE_NAME> --population <POPULATION_NUMBER> (the one you got from the prepare step) --generations <MAX_GENERATIONS_NUMBER> --verbosity <VERBOSITY_LEVEL>
```
In the future, if you want to load new logs to an existing map file, run
```
firecracker load --file <LOGS_FILE_PATH> --map <MAPPED_FILE_PATH>
```
# üöß Roadmap

 - [x] OAS 3 support
 - [x] Passive checks
 - [ ] Homebrew/APT support
 - [ ] Custom scans - optional checks + optional output + ignores(from alerts)
 - [ ] Swagger 2 support (currently only version 3 is supported)
 - [ ] Active scans
 - [ ] More passive scans
 - [ ] Swagger and logs validator (compares your logs with the swagger to verify correctness)
